# Fibonacci Generator in Python

## Project Overview
This project is a Python script that generates a Fibonacci series using a generator function. The Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. The script allows users to specify the number of terms they want to generate and outputs the series accordingly.

## Features
- **Efficient Fibonacci Generation**: Uses Python's generator function to generate Fibonacci numbers, making it memory-efficient for large series.
- **User-Friendly Input**: Allows users to input the number of terms they want to generate.
- **Dynamic Series Length**: Generates Fibonacci numbers up to the specified limit.

## Prerequisites
To run this project, ensure you have:
- **Python 3.x** installed on your system.

## How It Works

### Fibonacci Sequence
The Fibonacci sequence starts with `0` and `1`, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two numbers:


## Prerequisites
To run this project, you need:
- **Python 3.x**: Ensure Python is installed on your machine.
- Required Libraries: Install the dependencies using the following command:
  ```bash
  pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
