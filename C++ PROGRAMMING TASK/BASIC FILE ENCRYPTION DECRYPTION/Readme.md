# File Encryption/Decryption Using Caesar Cipher

## Overview

This project demonstrates a basic file encryption and decryption system using the Caesar cipher, a simple substitution cipher. The program allows users to encrypt and decrypt text files by shifting the alphabetic characters by a given key.

### Features

- **Encryption**: Encrypts a given text file using a Caesar cipher with a customizable shift value (key).
- **Decryption**: Decrypts an encrypted text file using the same key used during encryption.
- **File Handling**: Supports reading from and writing to text files.
- **User Interaction**: Command-line interface to select between encryption and decryption operations.

## Requirements

To run this project, ensure you have the following:

- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++).
- A text editor or IDE for writing and compiling C++ code (e.g., Visual Studio Code, CLion, etc.).
- Basic knowledge of C++ programming
