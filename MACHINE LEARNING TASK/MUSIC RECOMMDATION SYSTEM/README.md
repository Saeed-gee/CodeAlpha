# Song Recommendation System Using Logistic Regression

## Project Overview
This project uses a Logistic Regression model to predict whether a user will play a specific song again within 30 days based on their listening history. By analyzing user behavior, the system can recommend songs that are likely to be replayed, improving user engagement and satisfaction.

The project demonstrates:
1. Data preparation for user-song interaction.
2. Feature scaling for optimal model performance.
3. Training a Logistic Regression model to predict song replay probability.
4. Evaluating model performance using accuracy and classification metrics.
5. Making recommendations based on predictions.

## Features
- **Predictive Model**: Uses user behavior features such as time of play, day of the week, and play count.
- **Scalable Preprocessing**: Scales features for better model convergence.
- **Recommendation System**: Recommends songs likely to be replayed within 30 days.
